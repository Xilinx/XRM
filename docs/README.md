## Generation Guide

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables must be set before using the Makefile
to compile the document:

+ `HTML_DEST_DIR` points to the directory in which the HTML will be
  installed to.
+ `PATH` should include directory of `doxyrest` binary.

### Makefile targets

The top Makefile contains the following targets, each depending on the previous
one.

+ **xml**: call `doxygen` to extract the inline doc from C++ headers.
+ **rst**: call `doxyrest` to yield reStructuredText files from XML files.
+ **html**: call `sphinx` to generate HTML from generated reStructuredText
  files and manually written ones.
+ **install**: copy the HTML files to `$HTML_DEST_DIR`.

## Steps to update the doc

* Clone the `gh-pages` branch to a directory
* Set `HTML_DEST_DIR` to that directory
* Run `make install` in this folder.
* Go to `$HTML_DEST_DIR`, check in, and push to github.
